# go-toilfork

A library that provides simple functionality for managing a group of toilers (i.e., workers) where each is toiler
is basically the "same" toiler, for the Go programming language.

In this use case, the toilers are all created from a single toiler creation func (or interface) that is registered when
creating the toilfork group is created.
